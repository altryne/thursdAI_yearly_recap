# ThursdAI Q2 2025 - AI Yearly Recap
## The Quarter That Shattered Reality

*Based on 13 ThursdAI episodes from April 3 - June 26, 2025*

---

## 🔥 Quarter Overview

Q2 2025 will be remembered as the quarter when **video AI crossed the uncanny valley** (VEO3's native audio blew minds), **tool-using reasoning models emerged** (o3 can call tools mid-thought!), and **open source matched frontier models** (Qwen 3 and Claude 4 delivered back-to-back). Google I/O dropped an avalanche of announcements, Meta's Llama 4 had a chaotic launch, and the agent ecosystem matured with MCP becoming the universal standard.

Q3 2025 will be remembered as the quarter when **GPT-5 arrived**, **open source hit the trillion-parameter mark** with Kimi K2, and **world models became playable**. Chinese labs continued their open-source dominance with Qwen, DeepSeek, and ByteDance releases, while OpenAI shipped both their flagship GPT-5 and Apache-2.0 licensed GPT-OSS models. Google's Genie-3 showed us the future of interactive generated worlds, and video generation reached "can't tell it's AI" quality.

# ThursdAI Q4 2025 - AI Yearly Recap
## The Quarter of Agents, Gemini's Crown, GPT-5.2 & The Sora Social Revolution

*Based on 12 ThursdAI episodes from October 2 - December 12, 2025*

---

## 🔥 Quarter Overview

Q4 2025 will be remembered as the quarter when **agents became real products**, **Google reclaimed the AI throne with Gemini 3**, and then **OpenAI fired back with GPT-5.2**. AI-generated social media went mainstream with Sora 2, and Disney's $1B investment signaled the era of licensed synthetic media. OpenAI restructured toward ASI, announced autonomous AI researchers by 2028, and launched agentic browsers. DeepSeek continued innovating with sparse attention and gold-medal reasoning models. The race between coding agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Amp) reached fever pitch, MCP was donated to the Linux Foundation, and trillion-parameter open-source models became reality. Oh, and someone trained an LLM on an H100 **in space**.
