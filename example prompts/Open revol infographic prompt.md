Infographic Prompt: ThursdAI – Dec 4, 2025 · “Code Red vs. Open Revolt”

Design a high-end VERTICAL promo infographic poster (9:16 aspect ratio) for a tech podcast episode.

EPISODE TITLE & TOP SECTION
- Main title at the very top in bold modern sans-serif:
  “ThursdAI – Code Red vs. Open Revolt”
- Subtitle under it:
  “December 4, 2025 · Weekly AI Roundup”
- Tiny line:
  “Hosted by Alex Volkov · @altryne”
- Include a STYLIZED portrait/avatar of Alex Volkov near the title, using my reference image. Make him look like a sharp news anchor in an AI cold war: slight 3/4 view, geometric shading, no photorealism. Add a subtle mic icon or waveform integrated into the frame.

OVERALL VIBE & STYLE
- Overall vibe: strategic, dramatic, like a movie poster for an AI information war meets Bloomberg terminal.
- Style: FLAT VECTOR illustration with bold graphic shapes, angled cuts, and strong contrast.
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT reuse last week’s soft neon-core / skyline / circuit-board-glow look. NO circular “reactor core”, NO cute or rounded pills.
- Use angular elements: diagonals, slashes, wedges, hard-edged panels, occasional halftone or scanline textures for retro-tech flavor.

COLOR PALETTE & SPLIT
- Base: deep charcoal, obsidian black, and midnight blue.
- Split palette:
  - LEFT side = “Code Red” / closed labs / incumbents: hot oranges, reds, magentas, and gold accents.
  - RIGHT side = “Open Revolt” / open-source uprising: electric teals, cyans, neon greens.
- Use a central jagged RIFT or LIGHTNING BOLT shape to separate the two sides visually, with thin data lines crossing the divide.

MAIN VISUAL CONCEPT
- Behind the title, instead of a skyline, show an abstract top-down “strategic map” of an AI battlefield:
  - On the left, sharp geometric blocks with warning triangles, radar sweeps, and alert icons (closed labs).
  - On the right, fractal-like grids, open nodes, arrows fanning outward (open-source).
- From the center of the poster, a vertical or diagonal schism runs downwards, as if the surface has cracked. This rift separates the LEFT “Code Red” stories from the RIGHT “Open Revolt” stories.

LAYOUT & HIERARCHY
- Think of the poster as a split front page:
  - LEFT COLUMN: Closed-lab / BigCo stories (warm palette).
  - RIGHT COLUMN: Open-source & decentralized stories (cool palette).
- Each side features 3–4 main panels (hard-edged rectangles or trapezoids) with:
  - A bold short title.
  - A single concise subtitle line.
  - A minimal abstract icon.
- Under the main split, add a thin “ticker bar” for secondary topics: video, image models, and tools.
- At the very bottom, a strong footer banner with show branding.

LEFT SIDE – “CODE RED / CLOSED LABS”
Use warm oranges/reds/golds for panel backgrounds or borders.

1) Panel: “OpenAI · Code Red & Garlic”
   - Subtitle: “Emergency focus on ChatGPT · new Garlic model to counter Gemini”
   - Icon: A red alert klaxon / siren with a stylized garlic bulb silhouette inside, emitting triangular warning beams.

2) Panel: “Amazon Nova 2 Family”
   - Subtitle: “Agentic Lite & Pro · 1M-token Omni · hybrid thinking budgets”
   - Icon: A dense cloud outline containing four distinct nodes (Lite/Pro/Sonic/Omni) connected by workflow arrows.

3) Panel: “Runway Gen-4.5”
   - Subtitle: “#1 text-to-video · 1,247 Elo · physics-level motion”
   - Icon: A diagonal film strip morphing into flowing motion waves, with a tiny #1 badge/crown.

4) Panel: “Kling VIDEO 2.6”
   - Subtitle: “1080p video with native audio · synced dialogue & SFX”
   - Icon: A rectangular video frame with sound waves and a speaking profile silhouette; tiny music notes and waveform lines integrated.

RIGHT SIDE – “OPEN REVOLT / OPEN SOURCE”
Use teals, cyans, and neon green.

Make this side feel slightly more expansive and energetic—this week’s big narrative.

1) HERO PANEL (slightly larger):
   “DeepSeek V3.2 & Speciale”
   - Subtitle: “685B-param MoE · rivals GPT-5 · gold-medal IMO / IOI / ICPC”
   - Icon: A deep multi-layer prism/brain crystal with orbiting math symbols (π, integral sign, etc.) and tiny medal/trophy shapes.

2) Panel: “Mistral 3 & Ministral 3”
   - Subtitle: “Apache 2.0 models from 3B edge to 675B MoE frontier”
   - Icon: A stylized wind gust sweeping across four stacked chips labeled as abstract size badges (XS/S/M/L dots).

3) Panel: “Arcee Trinity (Mini & Nano)”
   - Subtitle: “US-trained open-weight MoE · 10T tokens · iPhone to H200”
   - Icon: A triangular trinity symbol of three connected nodes, with subtle US-flag stripes and speed lines indicating high tokens/second.

4) Panel: “Hermes 4.3 on Psyche”
   - Subtitle: “Decentralized training network · 36B model · 512K context”
   - Icon: A globe made of nodes with orbiting satellites; thin lines show distributed training paths, NOT a single big server.

CENTER / NEUTRAL ELEMENT – “THIS WEEK’S BUZZ”
- In the mid-lower center, slightly overlapping both sides of the rift, add a neutral, grayish panel (not warm or cool) titled:
  - Title: “This Week’s Buzz · W&B LLM Eval Jobs”
  - Subtitle: “Mid-training checkpoint evals · 100+ benchmarks via Inspect”
- Icon idea: a small model chip with bar charts and checkmarks rising from it, like a tiny leaderboard, indicating evaluation and monitoring.
- This panel visually “bridges” closed and open worlds, since eval tooling applies to both.

BOTTOM TICKER – VIDEO / IMAGE / DIFFUSION STRIP
- Add a horizontal strip across the lower third, styled like a financial news ticker with tiny icons and short labels.
- Use alternating warm/cool swatches to show mix of players.

Include three mini-blocks:

1) “Seedream 4.5”
   - Tiny subtext: “Production-grade images · multi-reference fusion & sharp text”
   - Icon: A camera shutter overlaid with multiple ghosted image tiles.

2) “Pruna P-Image & Edit”
   - Tiny subtext: “Sub-second gen & edits · $0.005 per image”
   - Icon: A lightning bolt hitting a picture frame, with a tiny slider/magic wand icon.

3) “Kling IMAGE O1”
   - Tiny subtext: “Understand anything · precise edits · bold stylization”
   - Icon: A stylized eye merged into a paintbrush over a cube.

INTERVIEW SPOTLIGHT – LUCAS ATKINS
- On the open-source (right) side, but closer to the bottom corner, add a compact “spotlight” badge:

  Title: “Guest: Lucas Atkins”
  Subtitle: “CTO Arcee AI · Trinity deep-dive”
  Icon: A simplified person silhouette at a mic, backed by a small trinity triangle.

BOTTOM FOOTER
- Full-width footer bar with a slightly lighter gradient over the dark base, spanning both sides (unifying them).
- Left: podcast mic icon with tiny neural nodes.
  Text: “ThursdAI · Weekly AI Roundup”
- Center: “Episode: Code Red vs. Open Revolt”
- Right: “AI Engineer Podcast · Live from New York”

TYPOGRAPHY & UI DETAILS
- Use a strong, legible sans-serif type across the poster.
- Titles in Title Case, subtitles in sentence case.
- Panels: hard corners, subtle inner strokes or thin outer glows ONLY if needed for separation—no bubbly pills.
- Maintain high contrast: light text on dark panels; avoid long paragraphs.
- NO real company logos. Use only abstract icons and shapes that suggest each brand/topic.
- Use diagonal separators, angular dividers, and occasional halftone/scanline textures in the background to emphasize tension and motion.

The final poster should feel like a **split AI war-room front page**: closed labs sounding alarms on one flank, open models staging a full-scale uprising on the other, with ThursdAI and W&B sitting in the middle making sense of the chaos.
