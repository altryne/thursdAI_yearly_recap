FOOTER BANNER:
Left: ThursdAI logo/mic icon + "Weekly AI Roundup"
Center: "Co-hosts: @WolframRvnwlf @yampeleg @nisten @ldjconfirmed"
Right: "AI Engineer Podcast · thursdai.news"
ART DIRECTION:
Grid-based layout — cards should feel like dashboard modules
Monospace or tabular fonts for stats/numbers (like JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono)
Clean sans-serif for headers (like Inter, DM Sans, or Satoshi)
Card backgrounds: Slightly lighter than main background (#1e293b on #0f172a)
Subtle borders or left-accent bars in category colors
Alex Volkov portrait: Small, professional headshot treatment in header
Icons: Simple, geometric, single-color per category
No decorative flourishes — let the data breathe
Mobile-optimized: Text readable at small sizes, clear hierarchy
Tree-style formatting (├─ └─) is for prompt clarity; render as clean bullet lists or stat rows
This approach packs in the actual numbers (Elo scores, benchmark percentages, parameter counts, pricing) while keeping it scannable. Want me to adjust the density, reorganize categories, or change the visual metaphor?
hmm ok, back to the drawing board, let's do a 16:9 one. Here's a good example from my previous Thanksgiving episode. This time, since it's december, it's snowing at least in Denver, let's do a December thematic but let's focus on the Code Red vs Open Revolt. I do want a bit more information in the panels, so I can show each one on the stream while I discuss the details. and focus on alex from the provided reference image as well. Remove anything new york related, this was then... I record live on YT, X



Here's an example, do not use the information from here, just the ... overall vibe

---

Create a high-resolution, wide 16:9 infographic poster for a tech livestream episode titled:



“ThursdAI – Thanksgiving Special • Nov 27, 2025”



Overall vibe: polished tech conference + playful Thanksgiving energy. Clean vector/infographic style, sharp lines, flat shading with subtle gradients, extremely readable at YouTube thumbnail size and on social feeds.



1. Hero & Header

	•	At the top center, a wide header banner with the title text:

“ThursdAI – Thanksgiving Special” (big)

“Nov 27, 2025” (smaller subtitle under it)

	•	Color palette: deep navy / charcoal background with accents of neon cyan, magenta, and warm Thanksgiving oranges.

	•	On the left side of the header, place a cartoon version of the host Alex:

	•	Use the reference image I provide for face, beard, and hairstyle.

	•	Style: clean vector cartoon, charismatic and friendly, wearing a dark hoodie and headphones or a small lapel mic.

	•	Alex is gesturing toward the infographic, like presenting the “AI feast”.

	•	Add a subtle floating turkey + circuit board motif near Alex — a cute small Thanksgiving cartoon turkey sitting on a glowing silicon chip, to hint “AI + Thanksgiving”.



2. Layout Overview – Three Main Bands



Divide the main body into three horizontal bands:

	1.	Top band: “Headliners” – focus on Claude Opus 4.5 and MCP-UI (MCP Apps).

	2.	Middle band: “Open Source & Video” – HunyuanOCR, Fara-7B, HunyuanVideo 1.5, Retake, Whisper Thunder.

	3.	Bottom band: “AI Art & Tools” – FLUX.2, Z-Image Turbo, W&B Serverless LoRA.



Use clear section titles with bold labels in pill-shaped tags.



⸻



3. Top Band – Headliners (Make these BIG)



Left Side: Claude Opus 4.5

	•	Section title: “Claude Opus 4.5 – Agentic Powerhouse”

	•	Visual:

	•	Icon of a robot engineer at a terminal surrounded by code windows and checkmarks.

	•	Add a small benchmark medal / trophy icon to signal “#1 on coding/agents”.

	•	Short blurb text (place in a rounded box):

“New SOTA for coding & agents – tops SWE-bench Verified, crushes terminal tasks, and adds an ‘effort’ knob for cheaper, smarter workflows.”



Right Side: MCP-UI / MCP Apps (make this central and prominent)

	•	Section title: “MCP-UI → MCP Apps – Interactive UIs in AI Chats”

	•	Visual concept:

	•	A Claude/ChatGPT-style chat window with an embedded mini web app inside it.

	•	Show small UI elements: charts, forms, a flight search card, and buttons, all inside a browser-like frame.

	•	Connect it with little arrows from “MCP Server” to “AI Client” to show the bridge.

	•	Short blurb text:

“MCP Apps standardizes interactive HTML UIs inside Claude & ChatGPT – charts, forms, and complex workflows directly in your AI client.”



Add a small label: “Guests: Ido & Liad (MCP-UI)” under this box.



⸻



4. Middle Band – Open Source & Video (Smaller but still clear)



Create four or five info blocks, each with an icon + one-sentence blurb.



Block 1 – HunyuanOCR

	•	Icon: document with text being scanned by a camera, with multiple language flags.

	•	Label: “HunyuanOCR – 1B OCR Beast”

	•	Blurb:

“Tiny 1B model that beats huge VLMs on OCRBench and doc parsing – cards, receipts, subtitles, and multi-language docs in one pass.”



Block 2 – Fara-7B

	•	Icon: a laptop screen with a highlighted cursor clicking buttons on a web page.

	•	Label: “Fara-7B – On-Device Computer-Use Agent”

	•	Blurb:

“7B vision-language agent that navigates real websites from screenshots, rivaling bigger cloud models while running locally.”



Block 3 – HunyuanVideo 1.5

	•	Icon: film strip with a play button and smooth motion arrows.

	•	Label: “HunyuanVideo 1.5 – Open Video SOTA”

	•	Blurb:

“8.3B DiT video model generating smooth 5–10s 720p/1080p clips on consumer GPUs, with clever attention tricks for speed.”



Block 4 – LTX Retake

	•	Icon: a timeline with a highlighted segment and magic-wand edit icon.

	•	Label: “Retake – ‘Photoshop’ for Video Lines”

	•	Blurb:

“Edit 2–16s chunks of any video – fix dialogue, pacing, and emotions without rerendering the whole clip.”



Block 5 – Whisper Thunder (teaser)

	•	Icon: storm cloud + camera over solar panels/wind turbines.

	•	Label: “Whisper Thunder – Mystery Video Contender”

	•	Blurb:

“A new unreleased video model showing stunning cinematic clips – early demos hint at a new quality bar.”



Arrange these blocks in a grid or a zig-zag timeline, with thin connecting lines and arrows for flow.



⸻



5. Bottom Band – AI Art & Tools (Emphasize Z-Image, FLUX, LoRA)



Use three main cards here, slightly larger than the mid-band blocks.



Card 1 – FLUX.2 (Highlight)

	•	Label: “FLUX.2 – 32B Multi-Ref Image Monster”

	•	Visual:

	•	A collage of multiple reference portraits/products feeding into a single high-res image.

	•	Show a 4MP badge and subtle “JSON/UI layout” hints like wireframes and hex code.

	•	Blurb:

“32B rectified flow model with up to 10 reference images, native 4MP outputs, and razor-sharp text/UI rendering.”



Card 2 – Z-Image Turbo (Highlight)

	•	Label: “Z-Image Turbo – Sub-Second DiT”

	•	Visual:

	•	A stopwatch next to a crisp image coming out of a DiT block diagram.

	•	Small badge: “8 steps • <16GB VRAM”

	•	Blurb:

“6B single-stream DiT that generates photoreal images in ~8 steps, with strong bilingual (EN/中文) text and fast distillation tricks.”



Card 3 – W&B Serverless LoRA Inference (This Week’s Buzz)

	•	Label: “Serverless LoRA on CoreWeave – Thousands of Experts, One Base”

	•	Visual:

	•	One central base model icon with many tiny colored adapters branching out.

	•	Add small “OpenAI-compatible API” label near a terminal icon.

	•	Blurb:

“Upload LoRA adapters as W&B Artifacts and hot-swap them on a shared base model over an OpenAI-style API – no cold starts, multi-tenant by design.”



⸻



6. Side Details & Branding

	•	Add a small vertical strip on one side with text:

	•	“Hosts: Alex Volkov & the ThursdAI crew”

	•	“Guests: Ido & Liad – MCP-UI / MCP Apps”

	•	Place a small Weights & Biases / Weave-style bee-with-a-wand icon near the Serverless LoRA card.

	•	Add tiny, tasteful icons (chat bubbles, GPUs, film reels, paintbrushes) scattered as background motifs.



⸻



7. Bottom CTA Bar – Subscribe Promotion



Create a strong, full-width call-to-action bar at the very bottom:

	•	Background: bright warm orange or gold gradient.

	•	Big text centered:

“Enjoying the AI feast? Subscribe to ThursdAI for weekly deep dives.”

	•	Under that, smaller text:

“Follow @altryne and get the newsletter + podcast at ThursdAI.com”

	•	Include simple icons: envelope (newsletter), microphone (podcast), and the X logo.



⸻



8. Style & Technical Notes

	•	Style: vector/infographic, clean lines, light gradients, no complex painterly textures.

	•	Priorities:

	•	Extreme legibility of all titles and blurbs.

	•	Clear visual hierarchy: Header > Opus/MCP-UI > Z-Image/FLUX/LoRA > other blocks > CTA.

	•	Avoid:

	•	No heavy background noise or clutter.

	•	No UI chrome from real apps; use generic, stylized UI elements.

	•	No watermarks, no additional logos beyond those described.



Render at 4K resolution suitable for social sharing and downscaling.

Extreme legibility at all sizes
Clear visual hierarchy: Header/Alex > DeepSeek/OpenAI > Other panels > CTA
Each panel should work as a standalone "slide" when zoomed in during stream
Avoid:
