## Description

Hey, Alex here, 

I recorded these conversations just in front of the AI Engineer auditorium, back to back, after these great folks gave their talks, and at the epitome of the most epic AI week we’ve seen since I started recording ThursdAI.

This is less our traditional live recording, and more a real podcast-y conversation with great folks, inspired by [Latent.Space](https://substack.com/profile/89230629-latentspace). I hope you enjoy this format as much as I’ve enjoyed recording and editing it.  

AntiGravity with Kevin

Kevin Hou and team just launched Antigravity, Google’s brand new Agentic IDE based on VSCode, and Kevin (second timer on ThursdAI) was awesome enough to hop on and talk about some of the product decisions they made, what makes Antigravity special and highlighted Artifacts as a completely new primitive. 

Gemini 3 in AI Studio

If you aren’t using Google’s AI Studio ([ai.dev](http://ai.dev)) then you’re missing out! We talk about AI Studio all the time on the show, and I’m a daily user! I generate most of my images with Nano Banana Pro in there, most of my Gemini conversations are happening there as well! 

Ammaar and Kat were so fun to talk to, as they covered the newly shipped “build mode” which allows you to vibe code full apps and experiences inside AI Studio, and we also covered Gemini 3’s features, multimodality understanding, UI capabilities. 

These folks gave a LOT of Gemini 3 demo’s so they know everything there is to know about this model’s capabilities! 

Tried new things with this one, multi camera angels, conversation with great folks, if you found this content valuable, please subscribe :)
