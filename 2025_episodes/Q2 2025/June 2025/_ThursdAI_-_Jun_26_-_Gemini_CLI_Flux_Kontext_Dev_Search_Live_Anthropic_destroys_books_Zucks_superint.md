## Description

Hey folks, Alex here, writing from... a undisclosed tropical paradise location 🏝️ I'm on vacation, but the AI news doesn't stop of course, and neither does ThursdAI. So huge shoutout to Wolfram Ravenwlf for running the show this week, Nisten, LDJ and Yam who joined. 

So... no long blogpost with analysis this week, but I'll def. recommend tuning in to the show that the folks ran, they had a few guests on, and even got some breaking news (new Flux Kontext that's open source) 

Of course many of you are readers and are here for the links, so I'm including the raw TL;DR + speaker notes as prepared by the folks for the show! 

P.S - our (rescheduled) hackathon is coming up in San Francisco, on July 12-13 called WeaveHacks, if you're interested at a chance to win a RoboDog, welcome to join us and give it a try. Register [HERE](https://lu.ma/weavehacks)

Ok, that's it for this week, please enjoy the show and see you next week!
