Hey folks, Alex here, writing from... a undisclosed tropical paradise location 🏝️ I'm on vacation, but the AI news doesn't stop of course, and neither does ThursdAI. So huge shoutout to Wolfram Ravenwlf for running the show this week, Nisten, LDJ and Yam who joined. 

So... no long blogpost with analysis this week, but I'll def. recommend tuning in to the show that the folks ran, they had a few guests on, and even got some breaking news (new Flux Kontext that's open source) 

Of course many of you are readers and are here for the links, so I'm including the raw TL;DR + speaker notes as prepared by the folks for the show! 

P.S - our (rescheduled) hackathon is coming up in San Francisco, on July 12-13 called WeaveHacks, if you're interested at a chance to win a RoboDog, welcome to join us and give it a try. Register [HERE](https://lu.ma/weavehacks)

Ok, that's it for this week, please enjoy the show and see you next week!

Hey all, Alex here 👋

This week, while not the busiest week in releases (we can't get a SOTA LLM every week now can we), was full of interesting open source releases, and feature updates such as the chatGPT meetings recorder (which we live tested on the show, the limit is 2 hours!)

It was also a day after our annual W&B conference called FullyConnected, and so I had a few goodies to share with you, like answering the main question, when will W&B have some use of those GPUs from CoreWeave, the answer is... now! (We launched a brand new preview of an inference service with open source models)

And finally, we had a great chat with Pankaj Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Yupp, a new service that lets users chat with the top AIs for free, while turning their votes into leaderboards for everyone else to understand which Gen AI model is best for which task/topic. It was a great conversation, and he even shared an invite code with all of us (I'll attach to the TL;DR and show notes, let's dive in!)

## 📆 ThursdAI - June 12 - Meta’s $15B ScaleAI Power Play, OpenAI’s o3-pro & 90% Price Drop!

**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Duration:** 1:33:10  
**Link:** [https://sub.thursdai.news/p/thursdai-june-12-metas-15b-scaleai](https://sub.thursdai.news/p/thursdai-june-12-metas-15b-scaleai)

Hey folks, this is Alex, finally back home! 

This week was full of crazy AI news, both model related but also shifts in the AI landscape and big companies, with Zuck going all in on scale & execu-hiring Alex Wang for a crazy $14B dollars. 

OpenAI meanwhile, maybe received a new shipment of GPUs? Otherwise, it’s hard to explain how they have dropped the o3 price by 80%, while also shipping o3-pro (in chat and API). 

Apple was also featured in today’s episode, but more so for the lack of AI news, completely delaying the “very personalized private Siri powered by Apple Intelligence” during WWDC25 this week. 

We had 2 guests on the show this week, [Stefania Druga](https://substack.com/profile/109432335-stefania-druga) and Eric Provencher (who builds RepoPrompt). Stefania helped me cover the AI Engineer conference we all went to last week, and shared some cool Science CoPilot stuff she’s working on, while Eric is the GOTO guy for O3-pro helped us understand what this model is great for! 

As always, TL;DR and show notes at the bottom, video for those who prefer watching is attached below, let’s dive in! 

Big Companies LLMs & APIs

Let’s start with big companies, because the landscape has shifted, new top reasoner models dropped and some huge companies didn’t deliver this week! 

Zuck goes all in on SuperIntelligence - Meta’s $14B stake in ScaleAI and Alex Wang

This may be the most consequential piece of AI news today. Fresh from the dissapointing results of LLama 4, reports of top researchers leaving the Llama team, many have decided to exclude Meta from the AI race. We have a saying at ThursdAI, don’t bet against Zuck! 

Zuck decided to spend a lot of money (nearly 20% of their reported $65B investment in AI infrastructure) to get a 49% stake in Scale AI and bring Alex Wang it’s (now former) CEO to lead the new Superintelligence team at Meta. 

For folks who are not familiar with Scale, it’s a massive company in providing human annotated data services to all the big AI labs, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic.. all of them really. Alex Wang, is the youngest self made billionaire because of it, and now Zuck not only has access to all their expertise, but also to a very impressive AI persona, who could help revive the excitement about Meta’s AI efforts, help recruit the best researchers, and lead the way inside Meta. 

Wang is also an outspoken China hawk who spends as much time in congressional hearings as in Slack, so the geopolitics here are … spicy. Meta just stapled itself to the biggest annotation funnel on Earth, hired away Google’s Jack Rae (who was on the pod just last week, shipping for Google!) for brainy model alignment, and started waving seven-to-nine-figure comp packages at every researcher with “Transformer” in their citation list. Whatever disappointment you felt over Llama-4’s muted debut, Zuck clearly felt it too—and responded like a founder who still controls every voting share. 

**OpenAI’s Game-Changer: o3 Price Slash & o3-pro launches to top the intelligence leaderboards!**

Meanwhile OpenAI dropping not one, but two mind-blowing updates. First, they’ve slashed the price of o3—their premium reasoning model—by a staggering 80%. We’re talking from $40/$10 per million tokens down to just $8/$2. That’s right, folks, it’s now in the same league as Claude Sonnet cost-wise, making top-tier intelligence dirt cheap. I remember when a price drop of 80% after a year got us excited; now it’s 80% in just four months with zero quality loss. They’ve confirmed it’s the full o3 model—no distillation or quantization here. How are they pulling this off? I’m guessing someone got a shipment of shiny new H200s from Jensen!

And just when you thought it couldn’t get better, OpenAI rolled out o3-pro, their highest intelligence offering yet. Available for pro and team accounts, and via API (87% cheaper than o1-pro, by the way), this model—or consortium of models—is a beast. It’s topping charts on Artificial Analysis, barely edging out Gemini 2.5 as the new king. Benchmarks are insane: 93% on AIME 2024 (state-of-the-art territory), 84% on GPQA Diamond, and nearing a 3000 ELO score on competition coding. Human preference tests show 64-66% of folks prefer o3-pro for clarity and comprehensiveness across tasks like scientific analysis and personal writing.

I’ve been playing with it myself, and the way o3-pro handles long context and tough problems is unreal. As my friend Eric Provencher (creator of RepoPrompt) shared on the show, it’s surgical—perfect for big refactors and bug diagnosis in coding. It’s got all the tools o3 has—web search, image analysis, memory personalization—and you can run it in background mode via API for async tasks. Sure, it’s slower due to deep reasoning (no streaming thought tokens), but the consistency and depth? Worth it. 

Oh, and funny story—I was prepping [a talk](https://youtu.be/KEdoIbBu2Ko) for Hamel Hussain’s evals course, with a slide saying “don’t use large reasoning models if budget’s tight.” The day before, this price drop hits, and I’m scrambling to update everything. That’s AI pace for ya!

**Apple WWDC: Where’s the Smarter Siri?** 

Oh Apple. Sweet, sweet Apple. Remember all those Bella Ramsey ads promising a personalized Siri that knows everything about you? Well, Craig Federighi opened WWDC by basically saying "Yeah, about that smart Siri... she's not coming. Don't wait up."

Instead, we got:

* AI that can combine emojis (revolutionary! 🙄)

* Live translation (actually cool)

* Direct API access to on-device models (very cool for developers)

* Liquid glass UI (pretty but... where's the intelligence?)

The kicker? Apple released a paper called "The Illusion of Thinking" right before WWDC, basically arguing that AI reasoning models hit hard complexity ceilings. Some saw this as Apple making excuses for why they can't ship competitive AI. The timing was... interesting.

During our recording, Nisten's Siri literally woke up randomly when we were complaining about how dumb it still is. After a decade, it's the same Siri. That moment was pure comedy gold.

**This Week's Buzz**

Our premium conference **Fully Connected** is happening June 17-18 in San Francisco! Use promo code **WBTHURSAI** to [register for free](https://fullyconnected.com). We'll have updates on the CoreWeave acquisition, product announcements, and it's the perfect chance to give feedback directly to the people building the tools you use.

Also, my talk on Large Reasoning Models as LLM judges is now up on YouTube. Had to update it live because of the O3 price drop - such is life in AI!

**Open Source LLMs: Mistral Goes Reasoning Mode**

**Mistral Drops Magistral - Their First Reasoning Model**

The French champagne of LLMs is back! Mistral released **Magistral**, their first reasoning model, in two flavors: a 24B parameter open-source Small version and a closed API-only Medium version. And honestly? The naming continues to be *chef's kiss* - Mistral really has the branding game locked down.

Now, here's where it gets spicy. Mistral's benchmarks notably don't include comparisons to Chinese models like Qwen or DeepSeek. Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis called them out on this, and when he ran the comparisons himself, well... let's just say Magistral Medium barely keeps up with Qwen's tiny 4B parameter model on math benchmarks. Ouch.

But here's the thing - and Nisten really drove this home during our discussion - benchmarks don't tell the whole story. He's been using Magistral Small for his workflows and swears by it. "It's almost at the point where I don't want to tell people about it," he said, which is the highest praise from someone who runs models locally all day. The 24B Small version apparently hits that sweet spot for local deployment while being genuinely useful for real work.

The model runs on a single RTX 4090 or a 32GB MacBook after quantization, has a 128K context window (though they recommend capping at 40K), and uses a transparent mode that shows its reasoning process. It's Apache 2.0 licensed, multilingual, and available through their Le Chat interface with "Flash Answers" for real-time reasoning.

**SakanaAI's Text2Lora: The Future is Self-Adapting Models**

This one blew my mind. SakanaAI (co-founded by one of the Transformer paper authors) released **Text2Lora** - a method for adapting LLMs to new tasks using ONLY text descriptions. No training data needed!

Think about this: instead of fine-tuning a model with thousands of examples to make it better at math, you just... tell it to be better at math. And it works! On Llama 3.1 8B, Text2Lora reaches 77% average accuracy, outperforming all baseline methods.

What this means is we're approaching a world where models can essentially customize themselves on-the-fly for whatever task you throw at them. As Nisten put it, "This is revolutionary. The model is actually learning, actually changing its own weights." We're just seeing the first glimpses of this capability, but in 6-12 months? 

**🎥 Multimedia & Tools: Video, Voice, and Browser Breakthroughs**

Let’s zip through some multimedia and tool updates that caught my eye this week. Google’s VEO3-fast is a creator’s dream—2x faster 720p video generation, 80% cheaper, and now with audio support. I’ve seen clips on social media (like an NBA ad) that are unreal, though Wolfram noted it’s not fully rolled out in Europe yet. You can access it via APIs like Fail or Replicate, and I’m itching to make a full movie if I had the budget!

Midjourney’s gearing up for a video product with their signature style, but they’re also facing heat—Disney and Universal are suing them for copyright infringement over Star Wars and Avengers-like outputs. It’s Hollywood’s first major strike against AI, and while I get the IP concern, it’s odd they picked the smaller player when OpenAI and Google are out there too. This lawsuit could drag on, so stay tuned.

OpenAI’s new advanced voice mode dropped, aiming for a natural cadence with better multilingual support (Russian and Hebrew sound great now). But honestly? I’m not loving the breathing and laughing they added—it’s uncanny valley for me. Some folks on X are raving, though, and LDJ noted it’s closing the gap to Sesame’s Maya. I just wish they’d let me pick between old and new voices instead of switching under my feet. If OpenAI’s listening, transparency please!

On the tools side, Yutori’s Scouts got my timeline buzzing—AI agents that monitor the web for any topic (like “next ThursdAI release”) and notify you of updates. I saw a demo catching leadership changes at xAI, and it’s the future of web interaction. Couldn’t log in live on the show (email login woes—give me passwords, folks!), but it’s beta on **yutori.com**. Also, Browser Company finally launched DIA, an AI-native browser in beta. Chatting with open tabs, rewriting text, and instant answers? I’ve been using it to prep for ThursdAI, and it’s pretty slick. Try it at **diabrowser.com**.

**Wrapping Up: AI’s Breakneck Pace**

What a week, folks! From OpenAI democratizing intelligence with o3-pro and price cuts to Meta’s bold superintelligence play with ScaleAI, we’re witnessing history unfold at lightning speed. Apple’s stumble at WWDC stings, but open-source gems and new tools keep the excitement alive. I’m still riding the high from AI Engineer last week—your high-fives and feedback mean the world. Next week, don’t miss Weights & Biases’ Fully Connected conference in SF on June 18-19. I won’t be there physically, but I’m cheering from afar—grab your spot at **fullyconnected.com **with promo code **WBTHURSAI** for a sweet deal.

## 📆 ThursdAI - Jun 5, 2025 - Live from AI Engineer with Swyx, new Gemini 2.5 with Logan K and Jack Rae, Self Replicating agents with Morph Labs

**Date:** June 06, 2025  
**Duration:** 1:43:45  
**Link:** [https://sub.thursdai.news/p/thursdai-jun-5-2025-live-from-ai](https://sub.thursdai.news/p/thursdai-jun-5-2025-live-from-ai)

Hey folks, this is Alex, coming to you LIVE from the AI Engineer Worlds Fair! 

What an incredible episode this week, we recorded live from floor 30th at the Marriott in SF, while Yam was doing live correspondence from the floor of the AI Engineer event, all while Swyx, the cohost of Latent Space podcast, and the creator of AI Engineer (both the conference and the concept itself) joined us for the whole stream - here’s the edited version, please take a look.  

We've had around 6500 people tune in, and at some point we got 2 surprise guests, straight from the keynote stage, Logan Kilpatrick (PM for AI Studio and lead cheerleader for Gemini) and Jack Rae (principal scientist working on reasoning) joined us for a great chat about Gemini! Mind was absolutely blown! 

They have just launched the new Gemini 2.5 Pro and I though it would only be fitting to let their new model cover this podcast this week (so below is **fully AI generated** ... non slop I hope). The show notes and TL;DR is as always in the end. 

Okay, enough preamble… let's dive into the madness!

**🤯 Google Day at AI Engineer: New Gemini 2.5 Pro and a Look Inside the Machine's Mind**

For the first year of this podcast, a recurring theme was us asking, "Where's Google?" Well, it's safe to say that question has been answered with a firehose of innovation. We were lucky enough to be joined by Google DeepMind's Logan Kilpatrick and Jack Rae, the tech lead for "thinking" within Gemini, literally moments after they left the main stage.

**Surprise! A New Gemini 2.5 Pro Drops Live**

Logan kicked things off with a bang, officially announcing a brand new, updated Gemini 2.5 Pro model right there during his keynote. He called it "hopefully the final update to 2.5 Pro," and it comes with a bunch of performance increases, closing the gap on feedback from previous versions and hitting SOTA on benchmarks like Aider.

It's clear that the organizational shift to bring the research and product teams together under the DeepMind umbrella is paying massive dividends. Logan pointed out that Google has seen a 50x increase in AI inference over the past year. The flywheel is spinning, and it's spinning *fast*.

**How Gemini "Thinks"**

Then things got even more interesting. Jack Rae gave us an incredible deep dive into what "thinking" actually means for a language model. This was one of the most insightful parts of the conference for me.

For years, the bottleneck for LLMs has been **test-time compute**. Models were trained to respond immediately, applying a fixed amount of computation to go from a prompt to an answer, no matter how hard the question. The only way to get a "smarter" response was to use a bigger model.

Jack explained that "Thinking" shatters this limitation. Mechanically, Gemini now has a "thinking stage" where it can generate its own internal text—hypothesizing, testing, correcting, and reasoning—before committing to a final answer. It's an iterative loop of computation that the model can dynamically control, using more compute for harder problems. It learns *how* to think using reinforcement learning, getting a simple "correct" or "incorrect" signal and backpropagating that to shape its reasoning strategies.

We're already seeing the results of this. Jack showed a clear trend: as models get better at reasoning, they're also using more test-time compute. This paradigm also gives developers a "thinking budget" slider in the API for Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro, allowing a continuous trade-off between cost and performance.

The future of this is even wilder. They're working on **DeepThink**, a high-budget mode for extremely hard problems that uses much deeper, parallel chains of thought. On the tough USA Math Olympiad, where the SOTA was negligible in January, 2.5 Pro reached the 50th percentile of human participants. DeepThink pushes that to the 65th percentile.

Jack’s ultimate vision is inspired by the mathematician Ramanujan, who derived incredible theorems from a single textbook by just thinking deeply. The goal is for models to do the same—contemplate a small set of knowledge so deeply that they can push the frontiers of human understanding. Absolutely mind-bending stuff.

**🤖 MorphLabs and the Audacious Quest for Verified Superintelligence**

Just when I thought my mind couldn't be bent any further, we were joined by Jesse Han, the founder and CEO of MorphLabs. Fresh off his keynote, he laid out one of the most ambitious visions I've heard: building the infrastructure for the Singularity and developing "verified superintelligence."

The big news was that **Christian Szegedy** is joining MorphLabs as Chief Scientist. For those who don't know, Christian is a legend—he invented batch norm and adversarial examples, co-founded XAI, and led code reasoning for Grok. That's a serious hire.

Jesse’s talk was framed around a fascinating question: "What does it mean to have empathy for the machine?" He argues that as AI develops personhood, we need to think about what it wants. And what it wants, according to Morph, is a new kind of cloud infrastructure.

This is **MorphCloud**, built on a new virtualization stack called **Infinibranch**. Here’s the key unlock: it allows agents to instantaneously snapshot, branch, and replicate their entire VM state. Imagine an agent reaching a decision point. Instead of choosing one path, it can branch its entire existence—all its processes, memory, and state—to explore every option in parallel. It can create save states, roll back to previous checkpoints, and even merge its work back together.

This is a monumental step for agentic AI. It moves beyond agents that are just a series of API calls to agents that are truly embodied in complex software environments. It unlocks the potential for recursive self-improvement and large-scale reinforcement learning in a way that's currently impossible. It’s a bold, sci-fi vision, but they're building the infrastructure to make it a reality today.

**🔥 The Agent Conversation: OpenAI, MCP, and Magic Moments**

The undeniable buzz on the conference floor was all about **agents**. You couldn't walk ten feet without hearing someone talking about agents, tools, and MCP.

OpenAI is leaning in here too. This week, they made their **Codex coding agent available to all ChatGPT Plus users** and announced that ChatGPT will soon be able to listen in on your Zoom meetings. This is all part of a broader push to make AI more active and integrated into our workflows.

The **MCP (Model-Context-Protocol)** track at the conference was packed, with lines going down the hall. (Alex here, I had a blast talking during that track about MCP observability, you can catch our talk [here](https://youtu.be/z4zXicOAF28?t=19573) on the live stream of AI Engineer) 

Logan Kilpatrick offered a grounded perspective, suggesting the hype might be a bit overblown but acknowledging the critical need for an open standard for tool use, a void left when OpenAI didn't formalize ChatML.

I have to share my own jaw-dropping MCP moment from this week. I was coding an agent using an IDE that supports MCP. My agent, which was trying to debug itself, used an MCP tool to check its own observability traces on the Weights & Biases platform. While doing so, it discovered a *new tool* that our team had just added to the MCP server—a support bot. Without any prompting from me, my coding agent formulated a question, "chatted" with the support agent to get the answer, came back, fixed its own code, and then re-checked its work. Agent-to-agent communication, happening automatically to solve a problem. My jaw was on the floor. That's the magic of open standards.

**This Week's Buzz from Weights & Biases**

Speaking of verification and agents, the buzz from our side is all about it! At our booth here at AI Engineer, we have a Robodog running around, connected to our LLM evaluation platform, **W&B Weave**. As Jesse from MorphLabs discussed, verifying what these complex agentic systems are doing is critical. Whether it's superintelligence or your production application, you need to be able to evaluate, trace, and understand its behavior. We're building the tools to do just that.

And if you're in San Francisco, don't forget our own conference, **Fully Connected**, is happening on June 18th and 19th! It's going to be another amazing gathering of builders and researchers. [Fullyconnected.com](http://Fullyconnected.com)  get in FREE with the promo code  **WBTHURSAI**

What a show. The energy, the announcements, the sheer brainpower in one place was something to behold. We’re at a point where the conversation has shifted from theory to practice, from hype to real, tangible engineering. The tracks on agents and enterprise adoption were overflowing because people are building, right now. It was an honor and a privilege to bring this special episode to you all.

Thank you for tuning in. We'll be back to our regular programming next week! (and Alex will be back to writing his own newsletter, not send direct AI output!)
