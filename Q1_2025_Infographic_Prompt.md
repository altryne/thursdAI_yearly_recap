# Infographic Prompt: ThursdAI Q1 2025 — "The Quarter That Broke the Market"

Create a high-resolution, wide **16:9 infographic poster** for ThursdAI's 2025 Year in Review series:

**"ThursdAI Q1 2025 — The Quarter That Broke the Market"**
*January • February • March*

---

## OVERALL VIBE & CONCEPT

This is NOT a typical tech recap. Q1 2025 was **financial warfare, open source insurgency, and cultural phenomenon** rolled into one. DeepSeek R1 didn't just release—it **nuked $560 BILLION from NVIDIA's market cap in a single day**. GPT-4o images didn't just launch—**the entire internet became a Ghibli fever dream overnight**. This quarter BROKE things.

**Visual concept:** Think **heist movie meets financial crisis broadcast meets anime transformation sequence**. The poster should feel like you're watching three simultaneous explosions in slow motion. January is the earthquake. February is the aftershocks. March is the new world order emerging from the rubble.

**Style:** Bold, almost aggressive vector art with **dramatic diagonal slashes**, **shattered glass effects**, and **impact typography**. This isn't a LinkedIn infographic—it's a **movie poster for the quarter that changed AI forever**. Sharp angles, dynamic compositions, text that HITS.

---

## 🎨 COLOR PALETTE — "Collision Course"

**Forget safe gradients. This is visual warfare.**

**Base:** Near-black obsidian (#0a0a0f) with subtle noise texture — like static on a dying broadcast

**JANUARY — "The Earthquake" (CRISIS COLORS)**
- **DeepSeek Red:** Blood crimson (#dc2626) and crisis scarlet (#ef4444)
- **Market Crash Orange:** Burning amber (#f97316) 
- **Smoke:** Charcoal gray wisps (#374151)
- The vibe: Stock tickers in freefall, trading floors in chaos, something just BROKE

**FEBRUARY — "The Arms Race" (NEON WARFARE)**
- **Reasoning Purple:** Electric violet (#8b5cf6) and plasma magenta (#d946ef)
- **Lab Amber:** Warning gold (#fbbf24)
- The vibe: Every lab racing to ship, benchmark numbers flying, war room energy

**MARCH — "The New Order" (TRIUMPHANT CHAOS)**
- **Ghibli Sunrise:** Soft coral (#fb7185), peach (#fda4af), and sky blue (#38bdf8)
- **Google Revenge Green:** Victorious emerald (#10b981) with gold trim
- **Collision Zone:** Where Ghibli pastels SMASH into tech colors — gradient explosions
- The vibe: The old world crumbling while something beautiful and strange rises

**SPECIAL ACCENT — "Open Source Fire"**
- **Chinese Lab Cyan:** Radioactive teal (#06b6d4) and electric blue (#3b82f6)
- Use this for ALL Chinese open source releases — they DOMINATED this quarter
- Should feel like a rising tide that can't be stopped

---

## 1. HERO & HEADER — "Breaking Point"

**The header should feel like you tuned into a broadcast mid-crisis:**

**Layout:**
- **GIANT "Q1" in the background** — stylized, cracked/shattered, partially obscured by other elements
- Main title slashed diagonally across: **"THE QUARTER THAT BROKE THE MARKET"**
- Below in smaller type: **"ThursdAI 2025 Year in Review"**
- Three month badges arranged like impact points: **JAN** (red) • **FEB** (purple) • **MAR** (coral/green)
- Corner badge: **"1 of 4"** in a hexagonal tech frame

**Alex Volkov presentation — make him DRAMATIC:**
- Cartoon vector Alex, but posed like he's delivering BREAKING NEWS
- One hand raised like "you won't BELIEVE what happened"
- Expression: Mix of shock, excitement, and "I told you so"
- Behind him: **Shattered stock chart**, fragments flying
- Floating around him: 
  - A cracked NVIDIA logo silhouette
  - Ghibli-style clouds (but glitching)
  - DeepSeek whale emerging from digital depths
  - "$560B" in impact font, crumbling
- Headphones on, dark hoodie, podcast mic visible — he's LIVE when this happened

**Background chaos:**
- Diagonal slash dividing the header
- Stock ticker tape fragments scattered
- Faint benchmark numbers streaming (like Matrix code but it's MMLU scores)
- Small explosions/impact stars at key points
- The three month colors bleeding into each other like wet paint collision

---

## 2. LAYOUT — "Three Acts of Destruction"

**Forget gentle timeline. This is THREE COLLIDING EXPLOSIONS:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  💥 HEADER: Shattered Q1 + Alex in Breaking News Mode                       │

│  │             │   │             │   │  this is the payoff)     │          │
│  └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └──────────────────────────┘          │
│                                                                             │
│  Diagonal SLASH lines connecting them - like trajectory of impact           │
│                                                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🔥 BOTTOM: "What We Learned" + CTA with gradient collision                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The months should OVERLAP slightly at edges** — showing the chaos bleeding through time. Use diagonal dividers with glitch effects, not clean vertical lines.

## 8. STYLE & TECHNICAL NOTES

**Style:**
- **Bold, aggressive vector art** — not polite, not corporate
- **Diagonal slashes** everywhere — nothing is straight/boring
- **Impact typography** — text that HITS, not floats
- **Shatter/crack effects** on major elements
- **Collision zones** where colors meet and FIGHT

**Visual language for the series:**
- Q1 establishes: destruction, upheaval, chaos, but also... excitement
- Each panel should feel like it could be a movie poster
- Benchmark numbers displayed like sports stats or stock tickers
- Use SCALE to show importance — DeepSeek and Ghibli panels should DOMINATE

**Consistency elements for Q2-Q4:**
- Quarter badge system (hexagonal, tech-styled)
- "X of 4" indicator
- Alex avatar in consistent (but dynamic) poses
- Three-month structure with distinct color zones
- Bottom CTA bar with gradient collision
- Same aggressive typography system

**Priorities:**
1. **DeepSeek R1** is THE story of January — make the "$560B" impossible to miss
2. **Vibe Coding + Claude Code** define the AI coding revolution of February — Karpathy's term + Anthropic's tool
3. **Ghibli-mania** is THE story of March — it should be visually beautiful AND chaotic
4. **Gemini's comeback** should feel TRIUMPHANT
5. Each panel = standalone slide for stream

**Avoid:**
- Corporate/LinkedIn energy
- Gentle gradients and safe colors
- Too much text — let visuals SCREAM
- Generic AI imagery
- Anything that could be called "vanilla"

**Alex should look:**
- Like he's reporting from a disaster zone (in a good way)
- Excited but also slightly overwhelmed
- "This quarter was INSANE" energy
- Breaking news anchor meets podcast host

**Resolution:** 4K (3840×2160) for streaming and social.

## QUOTE — Make This Prominent Somewhere

**Style it like graffiti or impact text:**
