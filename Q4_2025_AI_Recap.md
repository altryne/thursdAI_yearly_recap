## 🔥 Quarter Overview

Q4 2025 will be remembered as the quarter when **agents became real products**, **Google reclaimed the AI throne with Gemini 3**, and then **OpenAI fired back with GPT-5.2**. AI-generated social media went mainstream with Sora 2, and Disney's $1B investment signaled the era of licensed synthetic media. OpenAI restructured toward ASI, announced autonomous AI researchers by 2028, and launched agentic browsers. DeepSeek continued innovating with sparse attention and gold-medal reasoning models. The race between coding agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Amp) reached fever pitch, MCP was donated to the Linux Foundation, and trillion-parameter open-source models became reality. Oh, and someone trained an LLM on an H100 **in space**.
