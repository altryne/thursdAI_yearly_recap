# ThursdAI Q4 2025 - AI Yearly Recap
## The Quarter of Agents, Gemini's Crown & The Sora Social Revolution

*Based on 11 ThursdAI episodes from October 2 - December 5, 2025*

## 🔥 Quarter Overview

Q4 2025 will be remembered as the quarter when **agents became real products**, **Google reclaimed the AI throne with Gemini 3**, and **AI-generated social media went mainstream with Sora 2**. OpenAI restructured toward ASI, announced autonomous AI researchers by 2028, and launched agentic browsers. DeepSeek continued innovating with sparse attention and gold-medal reasoning models. The race between coding agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Amp) reached fever pitch, and trillion-parameter open-source models became reality.
