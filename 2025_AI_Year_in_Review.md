# 🔥 ThursdAI 2025 AI Year in Review
## From DeepSeek's $5M Bomb to ASI in a Decade — The Year AI Went Mainstream

*By Alex Volkov & the ThursdAI Crew | Based on 50+ episodes from January 2 - December 5, 2025*

## 🎤 A Note from Alex

Friends, what a year. When I started 2025, I thought GPT-4 was the ceiling. I was so, so wrong.

This year, we watched DeepSeek crash NVIDIA's stock with a $5.5M reasoning model. We saw OpenAI announce ASI within a decade—and a timeline for fully autonomous AI researchers by 2028. Google reclaimed the LLM throne with Gemini 3. GPT-5 arrived after 32 months of waiting (32 months of ThursdAI!). Sora 2 invented AI social media. A Gemma model made a novel cancer discovery that was validated in a lab.

Every week brought releases that would have dominated months of news cycles just two years ago. If you're reading this and feeling overwhelmed—you're not alone. That's literally why ThursdAI exists.

Let's look back at the year that changed everything.

## 🏆 The 12 Releases That Defined 2025

### 1. 🐋 DeepSeek R1 (January)

## 🙏 Thank You

To everyone who listened, read, shared, and built alongside us this year—thank you. ThursdAI exists because of this community.

Special thanks to our incredible co-hosts: **Wolfram Ravenwolf**, **Yam Peleg**, **Nisten**, **LDJ**, and **Ryan Carson**. And to the hundreds of guests who shared their work and insights with us.

We started this show because GPT-4 blew our minds. Now we're documenting the path to AGI and beyond. What a time to be alive.

See you in 2026. Hold on to your butts.
